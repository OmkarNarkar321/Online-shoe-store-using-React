This project is a React-based online shoe store where users can view shoes, add them to a cart, and manage quantities. It uses the useState hook for state management and displays the total cost of items in the cart. The app includes features like adding, removing, and updating shoe quantities, along with product images. The UI is designed to be clean, attractive, and interactive using Tailwind CSS.
